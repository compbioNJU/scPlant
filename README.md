scPlant: a versatile framework for single-cell transcriptomic data analysis in plants.


The scPlant pipeline is implemented with plentiful functions for diverse analytical
tasks, ranging from basic data processing to advanced demands such as cell type annotation and
deconvolution, trajectory inference, cross-species data integration and cell-type specific gene regulatory
network construction.
