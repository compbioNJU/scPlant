First, please make sure that you have previously performed the pre-processing, functional annotation, gene regulatory network construction steps, see [Pre-processing](pre-processing.html), [Functional annotation](functional_annotation.html), [Gene regulatory network construction](regulatory_network.html).

The gene regulatory network, differentially expressed genes, and functional annotation can be explored interactively in the built-in Shiny web application.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(scPlant)
load_shinyApp(SeuratObj)
# It should be noted that an object named "SeuratObj" is needed in your global environment.
```

The Shiny app is demonstrated in the following image:
